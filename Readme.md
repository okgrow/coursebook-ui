# OK GROW! kwiz

> OK GROW! kwiz is a fork of Arunoda's amazing "coursebook" repositories. It consists of this repo: okgrow/coursebook-server and okgrow/coursebook-ui

This is the code powering the UI for [OK GROW! kwiz](https://okgrow-coursebook-ui.now.sh/). The app was built in an effort to **keep users up to date with details around various frameworks like React and GraphQL**. The code for this app was made public to encourage users to **discuss answers and add questions**.
